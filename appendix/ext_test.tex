\section{Expanded Test Set Results}
\label{app:exp.results}


We show full automatic evaluation metrics from the E2E official
evaluation script. E2E and ViGGO results are shown in \autoref{app:e2e.auto}
and \autoref{app:viggo.auto} respectively.
We also show full manual semantic evaluation results in \autoref{app:e2e.sem}
and \autoref{app:viggo.sem} for E2E and ViGGO respectively.
We break out the counts of missing, wrong, and added attributes used for SER
calculation. Wrong attributes occur when an attribute is realized with 
the wrong value. Added attribute indicate the model realized an attribute-value
that was not given in the input MR. Repeated attributes, even when specified
in the input MR are included in added counts.
We also include the percentage of utterances with correct
semantics regardless of order (Perf.).
