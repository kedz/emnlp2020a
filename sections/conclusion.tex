\section{Conclusion}

We present an empirical study on the effects of linearization order
and phrase based data augmentation on controllable
MR-to-text generation. Our findings support the importance of
aligned linearization and phrase training for improving model control.
Additionally, we identify limitations to this ability, specifically in the small data, random permutation setting, and will focus on this going forward.
