\subsection{Phrase-based Data Augmentation}
\label{sec:dataaug}

We augment the training data with MR/utterance pairs taken from constituent
phrases in the original training data.  We parse all training utterances and
enumerate all constituent phrases governed by NP, VP, ADJP, ADVP, PP, S, 
or Sbar
non-terminals.\footnote{We used the
\href{https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/}{Stanford CoreNLP parser
v3.9.2}.} We then apply the attribute-value matching rules used for
\lsshort{At} (see \autoref{sec:align}) to obtain a corresponding MR, keeping
the dialogue act of the original utterance. We discard phrases with no realized
attributes.  See \autoref{tab:main.dataset.stats} for augmented data
statistics.

Because we reclassify the MR of phrases using the matching rules, the
augmented  data includes examples of how to invert binary attributes, e.g.
from the phrase ``\U{is not on Mac,}'' which implies
\AV{has\_mac\_release}{no,} we obtain the phrase ``\U{on Mac}''
which implies \AV{has\_mac\_release}{yes.} When presenting the linearized
MR of phrase examples to the model encoder we prepend and append phrase
specific \textit{start} and \textit{stop} tokens respectively (e.g.,
\textit{start-NP} and \textit{stop-NP}) to discourage the model from ever
producing an incomplete sentence when generating for a complete MR.
